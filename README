# JayMacro

This program is based off of the most excellent, but currently not maintained(as far as I know) xmacro program. I was looking for
a program to automate testing of a gui application that was 100% user simulation, or as 100% as you can get. I tried xnee, xdotool
and similar others. What I wanted was something similar to AutoIt.

I considered writing something using v8 that connects up with the XTEST lib, however; there is the small problem of writing a macro recorder,
which is an essential component to creating automated tests(It's nice that you can move the mouse, but finding the x,y is tedious), so I 
dumped that in favor of simply building off of an existing program.

I needed something with simple logic components, nothing fancy.

JayMacro sports an ASM like language (Optional, all old xmacro scripts will run out of the box) that lets you have loops, subroutines,
variables and other goodies.
